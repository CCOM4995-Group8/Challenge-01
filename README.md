Making the Walls: 
Firstly, we added a cube into the scene and used the scaling transformation to make it into a wall. Then we duplicated said wall and placed them as the three walls that are adjacent to the door/opening.

Making the entrance:
Then, we placed a new cube into the scene and used the coordinates in the inspect tab to make it have the same height and width as the walls, but much shorter in length.
Then, we duplicated that cube and placed them next to each wall respectively with a space in between. For the top of the doorframe, we added a cube and placed it in between them.

Making the roof:
Lastly, for the roof, we placed another cube and used the scaling tool to make it longer and thinner.
Then, once in the right position, we used the rotating tool to make it slant in the correct direction.
Once it was slanted at the right angle, we duplicated the cube to make the other half of the roof and simply put them together.

What we found interesting:

In this challenge, we found it interesting that we can see how much time we spent in making one house, 
and we can appreciate how much time and effort game developers put into making games for their audience. 
Additionally, it was interesting how much you can make with just one simple shape, considering that 
the entire house was made from one single shape: the cube. Likewise,  it was nice to learn about the
tools we have in our disposal that move, rotate, and scale. If all this can be done with only those 
three tools, imagine how much you can make with all the tools provided to us.
